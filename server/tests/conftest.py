# Real-store write guard — structural fix for the recurring phantom "alpha"    #
# account leak (PR #98, and the test-store-leak trap that kept reappearing).   #

# `paths.slot_path()` reads CCSWITCH_HOME lazily at call time, defaulting to   #
# the user's REAL ~/.claude-accounts. A test that seeds a credential via       #
# `write_json_secure(paths.slot_path(name), ...)` BEFORE entering its          #
# `with patch.dict(os.environ, {"CCSWITCH_HOME": tmp})` block writes a fake    #
# `*.cred.json` into the real store. Account discovery globs                   #
# `store/*.cred.json`, so the live usage poller then picks it up, fails auth,  #
# and stamps needs-reauth into the real ledger — a phantom account that        #
# reappears every test run.                                                    #

# `write_json_secure` is the SOLE store-write primitive in the codebase, so    #
# wrapping it here turns a silent production-state corruption into an          #
# immediate, loud test failure that points at the exact fix.                   #
